//What can be done to make this project better
(NOTE-1: Using slight moderations in the code 
	like,
	1. Exception Handling
	2. Using Python GUI

	This project can be used in production

NOTE-2: The code can be Transformed to be used in other fields like ,
		1. Hospital
		(Project Name : Hospital Management System)
		(We need to change 
			a) Database and table name
			b) Various Variables name
		)
		2. Various Shops , etc.
)


//Explanation
1. First first_time.py is needed to be executed as it creates database project1 and table student . 
	a)This program also takes input for the destination folder to store the images of students. 
	b)It copies the destination to the main program (i.e Project1_main.py) 
2.Then, helper_proj1.py needs to be executed.
	a) It copies the proj1.py code the  Project1_main.py
	(bcz, we need to get the destination path and the main code in the same file and this is the file which will be executed again and again)
3. At last you will run the main program i.e Project1_main.py


Execution Steps:
1. Run first_time.py once
2. Run helper_proj1.py once
3. Project1_main.py is the main code you can run this again and again
	// for giving input to the database and storing images
	//or , seeing stored data or stored image
